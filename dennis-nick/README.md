# Node JS - NPM - Express

**Author**: Dennis-Nick
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This application is allowing us to create a route and callback that will populate the new.html file via creating a server and a port to import the data

## Getting Started
1. You have to load node js and the npm packages onto your machine. You also have to load express package to create a server on your local machine.
2. You have to initialize a project with npm init.

## Architecture
1. This design is creating a package.json and setting up an Express framework so we can add data via the server instead of copy pasting into the data file
2. We are using NodeJS libraries and dependencies
